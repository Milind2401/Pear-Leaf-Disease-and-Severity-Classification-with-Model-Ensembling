**ENHANCING ACCURACY OF PEAR CROP DISEASE CLASSIFICATION AND SEVERITY USING ENSEMBLING**
The primary challenge addressed in this project is the need for highly accurate classification models to categorize pear crops into five different severity levels based on leaf images. This is crucial in agricultural management for timely and effective intervention. The existing models show moderate accuracy, and there is a significant need to improve this for better practical applicability.

**Objectives**
To implement and assess various architectures to find the most suitable for the task.
To analyze model performance to identify strengths and weaknesses across different approaches.
Improve model accuracy through architecture optimization and data augmentation.
To test advanced deep learning architectures to optimize performance.
To measure key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model comparison.
To apply ensembling on classifcation models.
